# Sequential Thinking Tool Configuration
name: sequentialthinking
tool_type: native
description: |
  A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.
  This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.
  Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.
  
  When to use this tool:
  - Breaking down complex problems into steps
  - Planning and design with room for revision
  - Analysis that might need course correction
  - Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
  - Problems that require a multi-step solution
  - Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
  - Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out
  
  Key features:
  - You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress
  - You can question or revise previous thoughts
  - You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end
  - You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches
  - Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack
  - Generates a solution hypothesis
  - Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
  - Repeats the process until satisfied
  - Provides a correct answer
